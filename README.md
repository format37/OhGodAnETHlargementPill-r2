## Troubleshooting   
   
Does your ETHlargement not work as expected? You're likely running an older memory revision. Here at OhGodACompany, we believe in promotiong a healthy mining lifestyle - that's why we've got a solution for our senior users, too!   
   
With the use of --revA, you can specify which device should be fed our senior solution. If, for example, GPU 0, 3 and 4 aren't the young studs you thought they were, feed them with the following commands:   
   
./OhGodAnETHlargementPill --revA 0,3,4   
   
Be sure to leave ETHlargement running in the background, so your NVIDIA noodle can *aldente*.
